# Javascript Reforce 
Repository to strengthen Javascript knowledge ⬆️ :fire:

In this repository you will find several files with specific topics in javascript which I developed in order to understand and improve my understanding of different concepts in the language... Usually each file corresponds to a specific topic and you can see the results by accessing the specific file with the command `npm run start -- [dir of file]` and see the results in console.

Example:
```sh
npm run start -- prototypes/prototype.js
```
